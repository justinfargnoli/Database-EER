The Database folder includes past projects that me and a group of friends have worked on. I'll provide some detail on each database in reverse chronoligical order to better understand them. Also, all databases have been queried numerous times to test and practice querying, but unfortunaly not all queries were saved, and therefore are not stored here. 

Review Book Order - This is database was the culmination of all of our work throught the course. The database modeled students placing one or multiple orders of a review book for a certain course, who the students teacher was, and what class the student was in. The .sql file also include fake data that was used when we tested and queried the database. 

Keys - This database was created to model who has what keys in a organization and what the keys give an individual access to. This database is currently incomplete.

Students - The Students database models a student, their address, and their report card. The .sql file also include fake data that was used to tested and query the database. 

Cryptocurrency Pump Database - This database was created to work alongside the Crypto-currency Pump website (https://github.com/justinfargnoli/GitHub/tree/master/Projects/Crypto-currency%20Pump%20). This was our first attemp at database design. When we initially started modelling the database we didn't understand the complexities on data modeling. To better devleop our skills, we moved on to another project we though would be easier to begin with. Therefore, this database is curretnly unfinished.
