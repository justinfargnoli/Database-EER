The Database folder includes past projects that me and a group of friends have worked on. I'll provide some detail on each database in reverse chronoligical order to better understand them. Also, all databases have been queried numerous times to test and practice querying, but unfortunaly not all queries were saved, and therefore are not stored here. 

Keys - This database was created to model who has what keys in a organization and what the keys give an individual access to. This database is currently incomplete.

Review Book Order - This is database was the culmination of all of our work throught the course. The database modeled students placing one or multiple orders of a review book for a certain course, who the students teacher was, and what class the student was in. The .sql file also include fake data that was used when we tested and queried the database. 

Students - The Students database models a student, their address, and their report card. The .sql file also include fake data that was used to tested and query the database.
